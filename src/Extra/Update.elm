{-| Allows update call composition. Can be used with the pipeline operator (|>)
to chain updates.
For example:
update msg model =
( model, Cmd.none )
|> andThen update SomeMessage
|> andThen update SomeOtherMessage
|> andThen update (MessageWithArguments "Hello")
...

-- Inspired from https://github.com/ccapndave/elm-update-extra
-- @future: move to elm-spa for simple message tuple update.

-- Do NOT WORK ! tried wih SaveData |> andThen (Navigate url)...

For example
update msg model = model ! []
